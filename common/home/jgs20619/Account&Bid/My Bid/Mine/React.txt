Hello, there, Hope you are doing well.
I just read your job posting carefully and it seems like great fit for me.
Why?
First, I'm Sr Web developer have 6+ years web development who has rich experience in React.js.
Second, I am really familiar with React basic concepts and flow of project.
React.js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building UI(user interface)s specifically for SPA(single-page application)s.
React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.
So I studied eagerly about React.js in my last career and made lots of websites using this.
The one of my representatives is https://shoclef.com/.
This site is made by Next.js that is react framework for SSR(server side rendering).
I can deliver 100% of perfect result within deadline that you determined.
I hope to discuss with you to reduce work time and clear understanding about project.
Best regards.
