========================= Tell me about your self ================
Hi, how's it going?
My name is Zhang Yuan from Hong Kong.
I am a full stack developer who have the strengths are in giving realistic promises, being responsive and responsible, concentrating on business needs and communications.
I have graduated from The University of Hong Kong.
In that meantime, I've majored in Computer science and I got a Bachelor's degree.
You know, I have worked in two companies, mainly as a React Frontend Engineer.
More specifically, I have worked as a Frontend Engineer for Ninja Van. 
During that time, I was responsible for developing and implementing user interface components using React.js concepts and workflows such as Redux, Flux, and Webpack. I was also responsible for profiling and improving front-end performance and documenting our front-end codebase.
To ensure success as a react.js developer, I tried hard to have in-depth knowledge of JavaScript, TypeScript and React concepts, excellent front-end coding skills, and a good understanding of progressive web applications.
I mainly considered on optimizing components for maximum performance across a vast array of web-capable devices and browsers.
Also, I have worked as a Software Engineer for Shopee. I was part of a cross-functional team that's responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment.
I have used an up-to-the-minute tech stack including JavaScript and React on the front end and TypeScript, Node and GraphQL on the back end.
I have designed front-end website architecture and worked closely with the Graphic Designers in this company to ensure website applications collaborate well with their design elements.
I've often overseen an entire project from start to finish.
Due to Covid-19, I had to end my role in this company earlier, and now I am working as a Web and Blockchain Engineer on Upwork from May 2021.
I have accumulated enough knowledge in Crypto Token, Smart Contract, NFT Marketplace, Bitcoin and Ethereum, Trading bot over the three years.
So, I have rich experience in blockchain, solidity, web3.js and NFT and you can check it opensea.io.
Using solidity, web3.js and smart contract, I have added collections and NFTs including ERC721 and ERC1155 assets.
Also I have developed many NFTs market places and you can check it here.

I have keen insight into what it takes to run a successful project because I have taken part in different successful projects across from startup to multi vendors.
My career goal is to have an opportunity to learn and grow my skills from a technical standpoint, and a chance to learn more skills over time. After reading the job description for this role, it sounds like this could be a good match for what I'm looking for.
I'd love to work for the company, innovative and ready to expand.
I think this company is exactly the one what I am looking for.

================== Why are you interested in this job? and Why should we hire you? ====================
I am so interested in this job because I thought it had many things for me to do.
Before facing this time, I had so many things to investigate.
First the roles of your company are React, Node.js, GraphQL.0
I have 7 years of experience with those skills.
So I can complete any task that you give me and I can bring a lot of profit to your company.
Second, I guess there will be so many talented tech developers and engineers who have high skills and technologies. I just want to learn a lot from them and compare my skills with them.
Third, there will be great managers who have high skills and leadership, including you.
In the past, I studied business once. I just want to learn a lot from you.
I mean, if you accept me, I will do my best for you and me
I love working in a startup, Until now, I have worked in companies which have pretty been growing up and expanding, thus what I did in that role is kind of maintenance and tend to be passive in terms of creativity.
But this company has really many things valuable to do like Ronday Virtual Reality, and I was so excited it is all what I would do.
I really want to contribute to the prosperity and development of this company from the starting point as one of the pioneers.

=================== Explain your strengths =====================
#1) Whenever new software is released, I'm always the first one to test and get familiar with it. I love pushing the edge and learning every aspect of the new software. In fact, just last week I found a software issue with one of my video games. I called the developer, and they fixed it right away. This position will give me the opportunity to apply my passion and help make programs better for your company. 

#2) I've always preferred to work in groups and find that my collaborative nature is one of my strongest attributes. On projects that I directed, I work well to inspire diverse team members and work side by side with them to achieve the project goals. In fact, I've increased productivity by ten percent over the course of two years. 

#3) My greatest strength is my writing skills. I work well under pressure, and I've never missed a deadline. One specific example that comes to mind is when I was asked to complete a project that a fellow colleague forgot about. My editor didn't realize this until two hours before the deadline. It was an important piece, so I got to work, and with feverish precision, I was able to complete the article. Not only was it finished on time, but it was received very well by readers of the publication.

#4) I'm relatively new to the finance industry, but I find that I'm good at working with numbers and I truly love it. I love helping people save money and finding new investment opportunities for my clients. Learning about their needs and finding ways to help them achieve the lifestyle they want is so gratifying to me, and I've helped my clients increase their net worth by 10% collectively. 

#5) I'm an empathetic person who is skilled at relating to people and understanding their needs. At my internship over the summer, I was working the support line and received a call from a disgruntled customer who had been dropped from our service. While the company couldn't find a solution for her, I walked her through other options she might have so she walked away with a positive interaction with the company. I know the importance of a happy customer, and I'm willing to remain upbeat and solutions-oriented.

#6) I believe that my greatest strength is the ability to solve problems quickly and efficiently. I can see any given situation from multiple perspectives, which makes me uniquely qualified to complete my work even under challenging conditions. That problem solving allows me to be a better communicator. I am just as comfortable speaking to senior executives as I am junior team members. I think my ability to see all sides of an issue will make me a great asset to the team.

#7) I know the industry inside and out. After working in sales and marketing for over 15 years I know I have the skills to maximize your marketing dollars and improve your bottom line. In fact, when I started at my last company, their sales were declining, and under my leadership, I was able to increase revenue in consecutive years, by 7% and 5%, respectively.

#8) My strongest asset is my work ethic and my willingness to step in when needed. I'm not afraid to take on a difficult client or do a project that nobody else wants because those are the clients and projects that teach me the most. I typically love to work outside of my job description and do whatever is asked of me. I'm not above any single task, and I take great pride in my ability to step in and adapt to any situation to get the best results for the company.

=================== Explain your weakness =====================
#1) I tend to be overly critical of myself. Whenever I complete a project, I can't help but feel that I could have done more even if my work received a positive response. This often leads me to overwork myself and leaves me feeling burned out. Over the past few years, I've tried to take time to look at my achievements objectively and celebrate those wins. This has not only improved my work and my confidence, but it has helped me to appreciate my team and other support systems that are always behind me in everything I do. 

#2) I am incredibly introverted, which makes me wary of sharing my ideas in a group setting or speaking up during team meetings. I feel that I had good intentions, I just wasn't always comfortable speaking up. After my team didn't meet expectations on two consecutive projects, I decided to start making changes to get more familiar with sharing my ideas for the benefit of my team. I took local improv classes and started trying to get comfortable discussing my thoughts. It's still a work in progress, but it's something that I've improved dramatically over the past year.

#3) I tend to want to take on complete projects all on my own without any outside help. In the past, this caused me to experience unnecessary pressure and stress. One specific example was last year when I was responsible for planning our annual event. I tried to do everything on my own, from the most substantial decisions like the venue to the tiniest things like organizing the table settings. I was so stressed leading up to the event, and I narrowly pulled it off. This taught me to take a step back and analyze when I need help. After that experience, I am trying to teach myself how to ask for help so I can keep my sanity. I've also found a team of people can produce a better outcome than one harrowed person. 

#4) I'm not familiar with the latest version of the software that you use. I've spent my time recently focused on generating a positive user experience and have always been willing to learn new things. Throughout my career software has always changed and I've always been willing to adapt to changing technology. I will put in the time it takes to learn this new software. 

#5) I always try to avoid confrontation, in both my personal and professional life. This caused me to compromise sometimes on the quality of my work or what I needed to complete a project just to keep the peace. This became a real problem when I became a manager. One of the most critical aspects of managing people is telling them what they need to hear and not what they want to hear. I recognized this weakness and had been actively working to voice my opinions constructively and helpfully for the betterment of the team.

#6) When I'm given a task, I am very goal-oriented and work hard to complete that task. However, when new projects come across my plate, I sometimes jump right into those projects and halt work on the projects I had in progress. Having to jump between tasks, so many times throughout the day hinders my productivity and prevents me from delivering my best work. I have been using a project management tool to help me manage my tasks and my time, which has helped me become more aware of prioritization. Since implementing this project management mentality, I have only improved my efficiency and productivity.
